## Guessing game
I finished this project quite efficiently. The main bug I ran into while coding was the code not flowing properly through the for loop. The condition for the while loop was being met only when the game was lost but not when the game was won. This caused the game to run infinitely and never progress to the 2nd or 3rd round. To solve this I did a little research and discovered the "break" command. This allows you to break out of the current loop you are in and now the while and for loop function correctly and the player is returned to the menu when the game is over after displaying the score and rounds won.
