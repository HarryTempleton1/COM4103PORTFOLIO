## Guessing game
random library is needed to run this program

I finished this project quite efficiently. The main bug I ran into while coding was the code not flowing properly through the for loop. The condition for the while loop was being met only when the game was lost but not when the game was won. This caused the game to run infinitely and never progress to the 2nd or 3rd round. To solve this I did a little research and discovered the "break" command. This allows you to break out of the current loop you are in and after implementing it the while and for loop function correctly and the player is returned to the menu when the game is over after displaying the score and rounds won. 

## Scientific Calculator
math library is needed to run this program 

For the scientific Calculator project I made use of the math python library. This library allows me to execute complicated mathmatical equations by calling the library using key words such as log(x) or sin(x). This drastically reduced the time taken to devlop the product as a whole as I do not need to write and implement the math equations myself. An issue i had while developing this project was error handling. Initially i have never used a try except statement before so i had to teach myself how they worked. I implemented try except statements to look for ValueError messages when taking integer values from user input. This means that when the user inputs a non integer value the program will display an error message and return to the main menu instead of crashing. 

## Cipher encrypyion and decryption
Initially I planned to complete the cipher encryption and decryption project as my third program, however, given time constraints and conflicts with events in my personal life it wouldnt be possible to complete this program to a level I'm happy with. Because of this I am going to instead complete the in class guided task sheets. 

## guided tasksheet lists and good coding practice
This tasksheet was relitively easy for me to understand and complete. The main issues I ran into were understanding the syntax for how to get for loops to behave how I wanted. For example making the list print backwards. I also struggled to understand what exactly the final plus minus task wanted me to do but once it clicked I completed it without issue.

## guided tasksheet variables, operators and conditions
I had very little issues with this task sheet. The only point I was stuck on was the maximum number task. I wasnt sure how to compare values efficiently but after some thought I realised that using a new variable named max and comparing each inputted value to it was the easiest way to determine the maximum number.
