## Guessing game
I finished this project quite efficiently. The main bug I ran into while coding was the code not flowing properly through the for loop. The condition for the while loop was being met only when the game was lost but not when the game was won. This caused the game to run infinitely and never progress to the 2nd or 3rd round. To solve this I did a little research and discovered the "break" command. This allows you to break out of the current loop you are in and now the while and for loop function correctly and the player is returned to the menu when the game is over after displaying the score and rounds won. 

## Scientific Calculator
For the scientific Calculator project I made use of the math python library. This library allows me to execute complicated mathmatical equations by calling the library using key words such as log(x) or sin(x). This drastically reduced the time taken to devlop the product as a whole as I do not need to write and implement the math equations myself. An issue i had while developing this project was error handling. Initially i have never used a try except statement before so i had to teach myself how they worked. I implemented try except statements to look for ValueError messages when taking integer values from user input. This means that when the user inputs a non integer value the program will display an error message and return to the main menu instead of crashing.
